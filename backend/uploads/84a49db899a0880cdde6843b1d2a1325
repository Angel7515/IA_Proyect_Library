  Previous issue date: 2022",,,"The war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia are and will continue to disrupt global wheat supply chains. Here we present a range of figures summarizing current data. This includes the supply of wheat: including its role of wheat in human diets, changing patterns of consumption and impacts of the current crisis (and preceding market conditions) on food prices. It also includes the data and statistics highlighting geographic export supply concentration and how this has changed over time. In addition, the global destinations of wheat (in the form of imports) are summarized, including specific vulnerabilities due to the current crisis, particularly in the Global South. All figures are made available for community use.","pdf","10.5281/zenodo.6470148",,,,"https://hdl.handle.net/10883/22050",,,"English",,,,,"CIMMYT","CIMMYT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CIMMYT manages Intellectual Assets as International Public Goods.

Heat stress during reproductive growth stages may reduce the yield by 101Kg ha day (Smith,1996). Extremely high temperature (45-48 C) during reproductive growth stages has drastic effects on maize productivity (Ulukan, 2009). Productivity losses in maize are attributed to flower abortion, desiccation of pollen grains & silk, reduced pollen viability & germination, fertilization failure and reduced seed size under heat stress (Sinsawat,2004). Leaf growth is reduced at 35 – 40 C while beyond that temperature there is serious reduction in photosynthesis, protein denaturation, inhibition of protein biosynthesis and enzyme inactivation are reported (Wahid et al., 2007). Day temperature may rise above 45 C in major maize growing areas of Punjab, Pakistan during spring season. Therefore, deployment of heat stress tolerant maize varieties is among the coping strategies to mitigate the increasing challenge of maize farming in Pakistan.",,,"1 page",,"Made available in DSpace on 2019-02-27T01:05:12Z (GMT).

Absolute replacement of OPVs with hybrids is not feasible due technical skills, resource limitations and financial constraints.

Anther extrusion (AE) has also been related to Type I resistance for initial FHB infection, where high AE renders FHB resistance. In this study, two doubled haploid populations were used to investigate the impact of the two dwarfing genes on FHB resistance and AE, and to elucidate the role of AE in Rht-mediated FHB susceptibility. Both populations were derived by crossing the FHB susceptible cultivar ‘Ocoroni F86’ (Rht-B1a/Rht-D1b) with an FHB resistant variety (Rht-B1b/Rht-D1a), which was ‘TRAP#1/BOW//Taigu derivative’ in one population (the TO population) and ‘Ivan/Soru#2’ in the other (the IO population). Field experiments were carried out from 2010 to 2012 in El Batán, Mexico, where spray inoculation was adopted and FHB index, plant height (PH), and AE were evaluated, with the latter two traits showing always significantly negative correlations with FHB severity. The populations were genotyped with the DArTseq GBS platform, the two dwarfing genes and a few SSRs for QTL analysis, and the results indicated that Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b collectively accounted for 0–41% of FHB susceptibility and 13–23% of reduced AE. It was also observed that three out of the four AE QTL in the TO population and four out of the five AE QTL in the IO population were associated with FHB resistance. Collectively, our results demonstrated the effects of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b on Type I FHB susceptibility and reducing AE, and proposed that their impacts on Type I FHB susceptibility may partly be explained by their effects on reducing AE. The implication of the relationship between the two dwarfing genes and AE for hybrid wheat breeding was also discussed.",,,"13 slides",,"Made available in DSpace on 2017-08-23T15:41:26Z (GMT).

Conducted jointly by CIMMYT and IFPRI for 12 sub-Saharan African countries, this study used geographic information systems, simulation models, and economic analyses to conclude that the countries are using less than 10% of their potential for profitable wheat production. Unlocking that potential will require changes in attitudes, policy and donor support for adapting farming systems, empowering African farmers, and developing value chains for seeds, input supply, and output markets.",,,"viii, 64 pages",,"Submitted by Carelia Juarez (alanberta26_5@yahoo.com.mx) on 2014-04-07T21:23:17Z
